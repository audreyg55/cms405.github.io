Luma Energy is a subsidary company from Atco Energy, a big Canadian-American coorporation. Luma's purpose is to tackle Puerto Rico's energy infrastrcuture by privatizing the island;s power grid (which was public until 2021). 

Although promising to be made "for Puerto Rico" (as shown in the advertisement below), the change has resulted in higher prices for energy, and less reliable service. All of this while also contributng to the forces americanization of the island.

In my design, I want to accentuate the hypocrisy by the statement "Made for Puerto Rico" written in English, as well as the lack of accuracy of its promise versus its delivery. Moreover, I also want to highlight how the richer areas of the island get disproportionately better service than those with less resources.
