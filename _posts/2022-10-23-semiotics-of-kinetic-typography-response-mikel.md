title: Semiotics of Kinetic Typography Response - Mikel

The article brings up pictoralization, informalization, emotivization, and dynamicization as cultural trends that have led to kinetic typography and I think McCloud has pointed to these trends in his discussion of comics. The comic medium has often tried to experiment with text in more visual ways, and maybe their place in society as a less esteemed artform is why these trends didn’t produce kinetic typography earlier. Also I think it's interesting that we now see the standardization of company logos like we talked about in class, because this trend seems to push back against the four listed by the article.

I think an interesting quote about the grammar of kinetic typography said, “Kinetic typography is not just an emotional overlay on words, but a means of expression in its own right.” It reminded me of the intuition vs skill idea that Dondis and McCloud talked about, since I understood “emotional overlay” to be akin to intuition and the grammar to be similar to skill. I think this paper argues that a grammar will allow people to find standards in kinetic processes that will help them make better design decisions if they don’t have the proper intuition. I also think a grammar for kinetic typography opens up creative possibilities since having a structure in a medium allows creators to push against it, which is often a practice people enjoy.
