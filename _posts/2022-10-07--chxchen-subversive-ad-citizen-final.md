For my final draft, I wanted to include more context on what the app was so it would be apparent at first glance even to people unfamiliar with Citizen. I also wanted to include some more insight into Citizen's method of paying for people to livestream incidents and how they compensate almost similarly to how TikTok and Instagram will pay creators to make Reels/TikToks and other media.

I wanted to add more attention to the "All on One App" part because it is ironically the vaguest part of the advertisement and something that will immediately set the mood of a perky all-in-one helpful gadget, before people's eyes wander up to the "trending murders, hot kidnappings" line.

Finally, I included a disclaimer footnote on the bottom right to visually balance against the Citizen logo about how Citizen won't claim liability for any damage that results from usage of the app even while it encourages people to get into dangerous situations.

I didn't change anything about the images used but enlarged the phones slightly so it was more obvious -- I really liked the juxtaposition of the utopic city against the arson and crime-tracking displayed on the side screens, and thought it was reflective of the "ALL ON ONE APP" headline screaming at the user while flanked by disturbing taglines.
