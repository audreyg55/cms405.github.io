title: Subversive advertisement - Katherine Caol Guo

In the USA, cheesemakers (such as Kraft) are subsidized to produce cheese, and because of those subsidies, they produce so much cheese that the excess is stored in a cheese cave in Missouri. There is so much of it that we will never be able to finish it all - we will never run out of cheese. This government subsidy of foodstuff is so absurd to me, especially when you consider the food insecurity that is so prevalent in our country - in the form of food deserts and food prices being unaffordable. I wanted this advertisement to highlight this inconsistency in the way our current system of food distribution works (or rather the way it doesn't). 

This advertisement itself is inspired by traditional Kraft advertisements I saw in my childhood which always utilized the Kraft navy blue. I wanted the photo to be realistic and aesthetically pleasing since those advertisements always featured an idealized family sharing bowls of Mac and Cheese - thus I choose a very symmetrical photo of the cheese cavern.
