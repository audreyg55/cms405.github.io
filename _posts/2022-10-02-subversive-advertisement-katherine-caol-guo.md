title: Subversive advertisement - Katherine Caol Guo

This ad is meant criticize the fact that the US government subsidizes cheese and American cheesemakers such as Kraft (in addition to other foods) to the extent that we have a surplus and have a cheese cave in Missouri that stores extra cheese that will never be eaten. I wanted to address the idea of food insecurity in general because there are so many food deserts and areas in the USA where people do not get enough food, and yet around 50% of all food produced in this country is discarded.

I grew up loving Kraft Mac and Cheese, so I drew upon those advertisements I saw, with the signature Kraft navy blue, the Helvetica that they always use, and an actual image of the Missouri cheese caves.
