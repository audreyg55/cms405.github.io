In this reading we were taken through an analysis of Durer's self portrait. I'm quite unfimiliar with art history so this was my first time learning about the background of a self-portrait. 

On first glance, the painting of Durer looks quite normal. It is impressively detailed, but it didn't strike me as unusual in any manner. However, as Farago takes us through the different parts of the painting, I learned why the painting is set apart from others during the reneissance period. During this period of time, it was unusual to have paintings of people who were craftsmen - and not rich, important figures. Durer also depicted himself in a seemingly arrogant way, portraying himself with a fur-lined coat characteristic of noblemen. His skin is also clear and unblemished and his hair is perfect and detailed. Another interesitng note is the choice of orientation. Durer's previous self-portraits feature him in a three-quarter profile, but even then his confidence and strong sense of self shows in the medium and subject matter (nude portrait and the use of silver point). The frontal orientation and posing is almost sacriligeous, as it is often used for Christ and saints. For Durer, a craftsman, to portray himself as rich and visually perfect is telling of how Durer viewed himself and his work as of equal importance to the holy.

Because of cameras, cell phones, and mirrors, the mental image that we have of ourselves is arguably closer to reality than in the past. When Durer was painting himself in intricate detail, he didn't even have an exact mirror, so he had to work out many of the proportions by hand. Its interesting that Durer also wanted to paint an image of himself that was more perfect than his actual image because we also do the same with filters and photo editing nowadays. Even in the past, the image of self we want to put is more idealized and embellished than we actually are.
