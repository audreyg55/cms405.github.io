I think McCloud made a very clear argument for how pictures and words together can open up the space of communication, and I think his story example with the woman buying groceries was very helpful in illustrating this point. I see this refusal to blend elements of a medium together in video games as well, since many think that good gameplay and good narrative can exist independently of each other in the same way McCloud says about comics creators.

I also thought it was interesting that McCloud gave us good examples of how pictures and words can work together, but still stresses that the actual blend should be left to a creatorâ€™s instinct (unlike what Dondis said about the pre-visualization of a composition).
