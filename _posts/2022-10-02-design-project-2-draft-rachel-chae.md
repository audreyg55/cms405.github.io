Many fashion brands claim to be inclusive but fails to represent such diversity in their advertisements. Brandy Melville is an extreme example of this: the brand claims to make clothing for the “everyday girl” but are notorious for only including skinny, white models in their campaign. They’ve particularly received criticism for their “one size fits all” sizing, which is actually a size small or extra small. While being a petite clothing brand itself not unethical, marketing their clothing as inclusive while catering to a very small subset of the population creates a problematic message.

In my advertisement, I wanted to portray the contrast between what fashion brands like Brandy Melville claims vs. what they show in their campaigns. While the text in the advertisement claims that the brand’s clothing is meant for everyone, the picture below fails to reflect any diversity in their models. As for the style of the advertisement, I used Instagram advertisements as reference, since social media platforms are where many fashion brands like Brandy Melville find their audience.
