Overall, I chose fonts where the accentuared "a" (á) was a valid character, as this is a representation of my first language, Spanish, which forms a big part of who I am.

**Bradley Hand:** I chose this font because of its roughness, which matches well with my personality and behaviors. I’m a bit disorganized overall, which then translates into inconsistency when it comes to my actions. Moreover, my handwriting is a little illegible as well. 
	
**Party LET:** I chose this font because of its clutter and elaborate designs. Sometimes, I tend be loud and expressive, and somewhat complicated. Due to this, I also wanted to select a font that was charged and complex. Additionally, I love making art, so I wanted to somehow symbolize my creativity, and the uniqueness of this font was representative of that.

**Times New Roman:** This font is one of the default fonts that we often use in our day to day. Although a little boring, I wanted to choose this font because it is dependable. I also aspire to be dependable and trustworthy in my day-to-day life, and I take pride in being a loyal friend.
