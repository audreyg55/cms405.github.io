In my ad, I wanted to call out how many calorie counting apps are gateways into eating disorders. While the app content seems to target exercise habits, it makes calorie tracking too easy and allows you to set calorie limits based on goals that can be extreme. It was inspired by their marketing and feature which heavily emphasizes tracking macros but portrays this in a nonchalent light.
