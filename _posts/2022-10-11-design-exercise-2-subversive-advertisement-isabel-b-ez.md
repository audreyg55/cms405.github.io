For the final version of my subversive advertisement, I focused on accentuating the idea that LUMA Energy only provided reliable power to a certain subsection of the island. 

In terms of visual design, I focused on using a font most similat to the one use in the company's advertisements. Moreover, I use recognizable iconography (the power lines) to highlight what the company's purpose is.
