I went with the phrase “update to upgrade” to have a more subtle idea pushed through the words. I hope that with the images of the phones stuck updating, and the frontmost one getting an update notification, that the phrase can be read as “updating your phone will force you to have to upgrade to a new one,” although I’m not sure if I achieved that.

I went with the idea of having each phone model be the same, to keep Apple’s clean/modern design and also poke at the fact that new models of iphones do little to improve on the old ones. I prioritized the polish, even though it might detract from the idea that the further-right phones are technically supposed to represent older models.
