Apple is known for sending out software updates that slow down older iphones for the sake of getting people to buy new ones. Their ads tend to focus on new features that people argue are only marginally better than on previous phones. They usually layer multiple iphones on top of each other for a clean look, but I used that depth in my ad to overshadow the broken phone. Their taglines(?) tend to be clean and direct which I tried to use to have the ad communicate their strategy.
