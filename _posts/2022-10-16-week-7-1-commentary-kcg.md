This reading was most interesting to me in terms of thinking about what constitutes “high art” and how accessible media is to the masses. High art since its very beginnings was provided for the elites by the elites (think of Chinese scroll paintings only being painted by royal scholars, think of the Medici’s sponsoring various artists such as Michelangelo, etc). Thus, I think it was interesting how McCloud brought up the time span of high art, going from being very representational (where theoretically it can be easily understood by everyone including the masses) to being more abstract as well as more focused on ideas and yet then, they were less comprehensible by the general public without a broader understanding of the context of that art. Similarly, in terms of text, way back in the day, text wasn’t even accessible to the general public because they couldn’t read, and also because books were in so short supply. Thus, in a way, high art and high literature were literally gate-kept and separated from the public in a way that comics aren’t and never really have been. I found it interesting that McCloud brought up the fact that comic artists however aspire to be “high art” because to me, the two are very different, and that is OK. For instance, journalism is considered to be a form of writing, but it is not literature, and yet journalism is a very respected field, with very prestigious awards and fellowships. So why can’t comic artists do the same with their field?
