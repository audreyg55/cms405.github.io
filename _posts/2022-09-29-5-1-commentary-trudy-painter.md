I hesitate to call the ad campaign from the Chicago Tribune *effective.* It was without a doubt regular and predictable. I always understood where I was supposed to look to find the takeaway. And I liked how the three images in the comic strip followed a formulaic narrative structure. 

However, I struggled to understand the differences between metonymy and conceptual metaphors and blending. A lot of times, I thought a comic strip could fit into multiple categories. For example, the metonymy where the person turns into a clown felt similar to the conceptual metaphor with the hot air conceptual which felt similar to the blend with the mind feeling stimulated.

I don’t think this is the fault of the Chicago Tribune, rather I was confused by the author’s categorization strategy. I wasn’t sure where metonymy would end and conceptual metaphor would begin.
