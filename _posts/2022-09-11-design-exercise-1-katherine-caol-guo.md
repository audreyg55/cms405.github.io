The current Boeing (an aerospace company) design was created by Rick Eiber in 1997 after the company merged with McDonnell Douglas. It maintains most elements from McDonnel Douglas' original logo design, such as the circle (representing the world), and the two swooshes which add dynamism and direction to the image because of their shape as well as their varied thickness. Overall, the design is recognizable and is in line with what the company actually does.
