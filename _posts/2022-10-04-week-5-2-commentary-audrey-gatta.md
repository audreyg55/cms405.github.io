I really enjoyed this reading; it communicated the concepts and choices in typography very clearly, and I appreciated the various examples throughout. Also, the layout of the page was very effective, with the main text in bigger type, yet also including details on the history of the example typefaces in red on the left, as well as additional comments in smaller type on the right. I loved the example comparing typefaces to various shoes for different purposes, and I did match 4 or the 6 fonts to the the intended shoes. 

I definitely agreed with the observation that “type in books hasn’t changed much over the last five hundred years.” I actually noticed this recently, because I started reading a book that is written in a typewriter monospace font, and I immediately saw the difference, which made me wonder why the author made that choice (I realized that it is to lean into the screenplay theme of the book). Another comment I found interesting (and agreed with) is that “Newspaper typography has created some of the very worst typefaces, typesetting, and page layouts known to mankind.” For the most part, I honestly do agree with this — reading a printed newspaper feels a lot like a puzzle with the page layouts and page jumps. However, this made me think of how nowadays, we mainly read newspapers digitally — how has that evolved the typefaces, typesetting, and page layouts used by newspapers?

For the emotion examples, I liked most of them but disagreed with surprise — I would personally have chosen a more bold type in all caps to express that emotion. I really liked the comment on the way some letter forms can be seen as illustrative, such as the Y in joy representing a person with their arms in the air.
