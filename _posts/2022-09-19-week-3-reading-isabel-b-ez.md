Upon first glance, I perceived Dürer's self-portrait as very polished and royal, simulating the portraits of Jesus Christ, as stated by article author Farago. However, it did not strike me as uncharacteristic of a self-portrait. I believe this is in connection to the abundance of "self-portraits" in today's day and age. With the popularization of selfies and social media, vanity is prominent in today's culture. Therefore, the arrogance presented in Dürer's self-portrait seems normal to this type of work. However, as Farago commented, flattenned mirrors were not even in existence by then, so this type of presentation was very unusual.
