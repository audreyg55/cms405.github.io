Upon first glance, I perceived Dürer's self-portrait as very polished and royal, simulating the portraits of Jesus Christ, as stated by article author Farago. However, it did not strike me as uncharacteristic of a self-portrait. I believe this is in connection to the abundance of "self-portraits" in today's day and age. With the popularization of selfies and social media, vanity is prominent in today's culture. Therefore, the arrogance presented in Dürer's self-portrait seems normal to this type of work. However, as Farago commented, flattenned mirrors were not even in existence by then, so this type of presentation was very unusual. This is especially comparable with the idea of presenting the best version of one self in a selfie and/or self-portrait. Even if he did not release this painting to the public eye, it is a show of arrogance, as he wants to witness himself in expensive clothing, and in a god-like context.
