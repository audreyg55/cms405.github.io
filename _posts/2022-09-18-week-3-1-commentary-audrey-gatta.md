I do like the way that Jason Forago described this self-portrait as “supremely arrogant.” In a way, all self-portraits are so, but I would agree that this one is in particular in the way that Dürer depicted himself in a front-facing pose with perfect symmetry, creating the sense of a holy icon, and especially with his clothing, dressed in a rich fur-lined coat. I also appreciated learning more about the details that were pointed out, specifically that of the hand pointing inward, invoking his gift of art. His monogram is also a key detail that is a reflection of his individuality and authorship. Also, it is important to highlight the purpose of the work: Dürer painted this self-portrait for posterity. This makes me think, what was the purpose of other artists throughout history when they painted their self-portraits?
