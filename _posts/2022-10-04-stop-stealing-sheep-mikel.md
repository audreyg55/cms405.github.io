“We read best what we read most,” was a funny line because it also served to incorporate the “audience” part of art into the understanding of how people interact with typefaces. I know I fall into this with Comic Sans, since I spent all of elementary school loving it. 

I didn’t really agree with the fonts chosen for the emotions except for Anger, and I think it's very hard for me to understand why a certain font might evoke an emotion. They made an argument for bold/dark typefaces pairing well with Doubt and Anger, but since the Doubt didn’t land for me I feel like they missed on explaining something more specific about the typeface that would have helped me understand the link better. I think the hardest part for me was to look at the singular word and see if the typeface could express that emotion. I more felt that “I didn’t know if the typeface worked here” but slightly leaned to it not although it could if more words were around it.
