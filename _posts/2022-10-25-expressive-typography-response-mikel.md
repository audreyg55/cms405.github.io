I didn’t fully understand what Small was trying to achieve in his thesis, or at least on a very specific level. I understood that he wanted some simulation to help make text move, some capability to capture voice and display it as text (but with intensity correlating to text size), simulate wet brushes as well as others, and I wasn’t sure what the discussion of quality meant. I think, generally, that nowadays there are tons of programs that do all that he wanted and probably more, but since I didn’t understand the full scope of his system I’m not sure if any features he wanted are still not accessible to us.

One thing I found interesting was his desire to make the simulation realistic in the wet brushes part, even wanting the individual paper fibers to have randomized color and absorbancy. I imagine this is possible already, but that most programs just assume a creator wants a clean-digital canvas without the real imperfections of paper.
