title: Week 2.2 Commentary - Katherine Caol Guo

Overall, I really liked this reading. In an alternate universe, I would have become a comic book author / illustrator. When I was in primary and intermediate school, I took many classes in comic illustration and consider myself relatively knowledgeable in Western (American) comics, so I really like the small juxtapositions McCloud included when describing traditions in Japanese comics and cartoons. 

**Abstraction levels of iconic representation**
I love the quote "One set of lines to see. Another set of lines to be." This is in context of the combination of cartoonish, abstracted character figures and the realistic depictions of the background and environment. The lines "to be" are the simpler, abstract ones of the figure through which we can more easily resonante with and see ourselves being, and the lines "to see" are the more complex ones of the background so we can find ourself (as the cartoon figure) to be immersed in the physical world of the story. 

**Role and effect of lines, patterns, and shapes**
