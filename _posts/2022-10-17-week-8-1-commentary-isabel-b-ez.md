McCloud dives into an analysis of how the relationship between text and pictures has changed over the years. He notes how the two have become more and more disjoint as time goes on. He highlights a fact I found interesting: that, as we grow older, we are expected to enjoy both elements separately. And that media with a close combination of text and images is perceived as child-like. This reminds me of games such as Skribblio, were users have to guess the word for what another usr is drawing. In this game, including words in your drawing is perceived as not valid or “cheating”. However, as McCloud highlights, in the early forms of writing, words were represented through abstract figures that symbolized their physical shapes. 

McCloud also discusses how the relationship between images and text varies in comic books. Sometimes, the text serves as sound implications for the scene. Other times, the imagery is just a compliment, or add-on to the text. Most of times, the text and imagery are co-dependent: neither makes sense without the other. The actual ratio for this is not always 50/50, but each has its own weighted influence on the overall scene. I think this relationship is crucial for comics, as they are one of the last types of media that fully depends on the combination between text and images. Nevertheless, it is still true that comics are perceived to be less proffessinal, or mature, that say a novel or a painting. This goes back to McCloud's initial point: that mediums which such text/picture combination are seen as more childlike.
