In this article, Neil Cohn identified and analyzed several semantics used in Chicago tribune advertisements. Since principles like metonymy and metaphors were concepts I encountered often in English classes, I found it interesting to see them applied in a visual context.

**Metonymy**

Cohn defines metonymy as using one thing as a substitute for another concept, and he gives several examples where different elements are added or removed to represent a change/narrative. I particularly found the example of the bus stop panel interesting, how you could add meaning and imply causation simply by taking away elements of the original image.


**Metaphor**

For me, the definition of visual metaphor seemed the most consistent with what I’d learned in English classes. I particularly liked the example he used with a graphic of steam coming out of a character’s ears. Here, he explains that metaphor comes into play because we’re comparing anger to a hot fluid. This example made me think back to the McCloud readings, where a similar image would have been used as a usage of symbols. It helped me recognize the intersectionality of these concepts.

**Blending**

I was a bit confused on the exact boundary between metaphor and blending. Cohn distinguishes blending from other principles by stating that blending directly combines two concepts as opposed to merely mapping two concepts. However, the examples he showed made me wonder if this blending is purely physical (e.g. gauge inside the head instead of steam outside ears) or if there is another element of conceptual blending I am missing.
