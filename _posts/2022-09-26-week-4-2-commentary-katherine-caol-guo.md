**The essence of art and the peak shift principle**
The wording Ramachandran used, of the meaning of art to coney the "essence" of something in order to "evoke a specific mood in the observer" was interesting to me. It reminded me of McCloud's arguments when describing and detailing how comics work. Usage of the Peak Shift principle, whether intention or not, is found in comics, as well as in "primitive" art as Ramachandran brought up. In the cave paintings of Lascaux, even today we know they were painting horses 20,000 years ago - the horses then, if we somehow had a photograph would likely be less recognizable than the paintings. However, it raises the question of what defines art - a question that is constantly brought up and pondered, and in all honestly will likely never be answered. Are very realistic paintings considered art (such as Dutch still lives), especially if the artist was most fixiated on making the representation look as real as possible, rather than have it convey a certain emotion? I also wonder about this focus on distinctive, differing features and their accentuation and this abstraction as 1) being a very deliberative process but also 2) just being easier to draw. Looking at art history, in the Western canon at least, there was an obsession with making things look as realistic as possible - it was only once that was achieved, did artists go back to the "primitive" in order to focus more on expression and meaning. Why did other areas of the world hold steadfast to this tradition of using the Peak Shift Principle?

**Isolating a single module and allocating attention**
Outlines being very effective in visual art is something I learned about in my neuroscience class - just the ways our neurons are set up in a visual system make us more sensitive to edges, just because of how we detect things. Part of it is for depth perception, part of it is because of our rods and cones, where rods produce sharper images but are in our peripheral vision, whereas cones are more blurry (but focus on color) and are in our central vision.
