My goal was to create a sense of **randomness** yet also **unity** by including random symbols and representational objects in various spots, while creating thinner lines that connect and tie them together. I attempted to portray how I find that many aspects of my life and personality are very distinct from one another and donâ€™t necessarily make sense (even to me) at first, but they all intertwine to form who I am. Additionally, I employed **distortion** in the background, where I chose to depict flags of my heritage and have them melt into one another.
