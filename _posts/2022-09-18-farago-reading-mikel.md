Since we looked at more abstract self-portraits in class, the biggest question I have is when that type of self depiction first appeared. Durerâ€™s painting is an attempt to capture himself in a realistic way, shown by the impressive effort he put into the details that make the portrait look closer to reality. I think by trying to draw himself accurately, it adds more arrogance to the symbols that relate him to perfection or Christ. Instead of interpreting himself through art, the painting reads much more as a statement of fact to me.

The reason I asked my first question is because I wonder if painters before Durer aimed to capture themselves in their work, but did not try to do it through realistic means, closer to some of the examples we saw in class that might not be read as self-portraits had we not been told. Are there prior examples of people trying to capture themselves in art?
