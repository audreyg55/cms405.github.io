The Line: The first element discussed in this paper is the dot but when several dots are positioned close together they form a line. The line is a dot in motion (it is not static), it has energy, direction, and purpose. The line can be loose and free but also measured and technical and take on different vibes whether that’s spontaneous or delicate. The text says lines rarely exist in nature but can often be seen in the environment due to its artificial nature. Lines are used to show contrast and describe juxtaposition. Examples of lines are dividers that section off/group ideas on a page, sketching lines/outlines used for drafting. There are vertical, horizontal, diagonal lines, etc. and the intersections of these lines create shape. 

The Shape: Dots describe lines, lines describe shapes. There are three basic shapes: circle, square, and triangle that each have their own meaning and connotation. Squares are said to be bland whereas triangles indicate action and circles capture the essence of endlessness, warmth, and protection. These shapes lend themselves to even more variations - more sides/angles or curved edges for example. Shapes draw in the eye and interest the person looking at the subject. Shapes are used to represent buildings, people, life, and everything with substance. Shapes are needed everywhere - thinking about clothing, for example, something that is “shapeless” is oftentimes bland or uninteresting. Shapes are also used to enclose/section things and provide a border (they help organize space). Shapes are symbols; likely the most obvious example is the stop sign - a red octagon - is nearly universally recognized as a symbol for stopping. Similarly a triangle with an exclamation point is taken to be a warning sign.
