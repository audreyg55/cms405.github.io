I think I liked the analogy Small made between information landscapes and gardens, and also that the design of a space must be fitted to the content it will display. I think that we mostly try to conform all the information we want to the basic layout of a page, and although there are probably modern attempts to display information in a 3d environment I canâ€™t think of any. I liked this reading because I believe I had a better idea of what Small was trying to achieve. His in depth explanations of the different constraints and considerations they had while making the Shakespeare Project were very clear to me, and I think the 90degree footnote idea was a cool solution that felt more realistically usable than others. I think by looking at the specific constraints Small had to tweak and design around I understood better how a 3d information landscape could be innovative as well as functional.
