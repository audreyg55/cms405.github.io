A big part in the creating of my self-portrait was balance and symmetry. Although not exactly equal, both sides of the face have the same composition: same flow of horns, same shape of additional elements, etc. This balance helped accentuate and highlight other intentional components, such as the slight bend of the top horn. I also focused a lot on color, particularly the contrast between vivid, colorful hues, and dull, more subdued tones.
