title: Map prelim thoughts - KCG
author: Katherine Caol Guo

**Experiences/imaginings**
-green spaces, mapping the condition of green spaces across Boston (like who upkeeps them, what kind of amenities are offered there, like enough space of soccer game, etc?)
—public restrooms in the Boston area
-hot dog carts/food truck maps
-flowering plants (versus just green spaces) in the Boston area
-restaurant closures/movement
-restaurants by cuisine
 
**Data sources**
-walking around Boston myself
-going on restaurant websites, going onto Facebook for various pop-ups
-public database of green spaces in Boston, or land under management of city’s gardening management department
 
**Inspirations**
