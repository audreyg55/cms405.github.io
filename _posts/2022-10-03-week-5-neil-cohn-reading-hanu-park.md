## Commentary

I understand the different sections and what they are trying to achieve, but I am having a harder time understanding the difference in the *what* of each section, especially between metaphor and blending. Besides this, I agree that the use of each method is great, and that each does effectively get across the ideas that a group like the Chicago Tribune is looking for. 

I can't cite specific examples right now, but advertisements for makeup, skincare, and bodycare brands do menotymy often. I believe it is because of the nature in these industries that focus around making someone better than they were before.

I believe there is also an ad going around currently that showcases a woman getting into simple jumproping and then kickboxing by the end.
