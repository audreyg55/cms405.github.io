In this article, Cohn discusses many interesting aspects of the composition of more modern comics. He starts by defining the usual structure of the three panels: an initial state, a causative state, and a resultant state. He describes this composition and its elements as formulas. 

He dives into a discussion of Metonymy: having one element dictate an important concept in the comic storyline. There are also different types to showcase this element: addition, alteration, or reduction. I found his example of element reduction to be the most helpful, as it was the hardest to comprehend from the start. 

His discussion of Metaphor is also very interesting. This reminds me the most to the recognizable semantics discussed previously. As an example, we have the visualization of anger, with steam coming out of the character’s head. This reminds of the classic iconographic representations of emotions described by McCloud. 

Blending was a little harder to grasp as a concept. Although it is stated that it is some sort of intersection between metaphors and metonymy, where the line is drawn between either and blending is a little unclear. The best way I understood this blend is as having one metaphorical element in the comic that dictates some important concept to the storyline. We can see this with the example of Einstein’s hair. Like before with the clown nose, and element that showcases the storyline is added. However, now this element has the additional layer of metaphor: as Einstein’s hair represents intelligence.
