I wanted to create more unity between the image of the cheese cavern and the background of the text caption so I introduced the gradient. I think the gradient also introduces a menacing / threatening feel to the imagery which adds to the the idea of how vast and wasteful these cheese caverns are in addition to the government subsidies that cause them in the first place.
