My poem is the following:
 > How do we feel time? I think time is a string of moments. They bleed and together. Never discrete. Sometimes they feel long and slow. Sometimes they feel fast and fleeting. And always, they feel infinite.
 
I weave all of moments of this poem together in the way I think I feel time. The cascading substrings communicate how moments overlap to create a feeling of time. 

For my animation, I want to add an infinite scroll that only moves forward and a counter that only increments upwards.
