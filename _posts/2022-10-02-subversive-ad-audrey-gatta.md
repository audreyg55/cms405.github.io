My inspiration for this subversive ad was from seeing a Facebook ad about the 'hide post' feature, which encouraged users to do so in forfeit to have more control over their feed. This make me think directly back to the role of Facebook in spreading election misinformation and the use of the platform to plan the January 6th Capitol attack. I found it pretty ironic considering that Facebook already fuels political polarization through fostering echo chambers, yet it is encouraging users to hide posts to curate their feed, which directly allows them to hide viewpoints that go against their own and fall even deeper into their own black hole. 

For the design of the ad, I mimicked some aspects of the Facebook ad I took inspiration from, such as the text format and the posts in bubbles. I chose to represent the posts being pulled into (or emerging out of) a black hole, to show that users can live in a vacuum through Facebook, surrounded only by posts that reinforce their own opinions, biases, and (mis)information.
