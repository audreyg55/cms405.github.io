I thougt about assymmetry in my placement of the fish. It felt more interesting and meaningful then to make them the fish offset to capture the element of freedom/not being bound by rules. Another technique I focused on was diffusion, I wanted the fish bowl to appear soft and diffusing/rippling into the background. I also used fragmentation in the sense that each fish has its own individual character, the units of the design were broken up into pieces.
