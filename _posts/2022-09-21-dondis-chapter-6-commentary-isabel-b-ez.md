All the elements that Dondi’s describes in this sixth chapter rely on a set of oppositions that correlate to each other. Many assimilate to each other, and even help describe their relevance in visual works. As an example, we have the similarities between sequential and randomness, predictability and spontaneity, and consistency and variation. Although not exactly the same, we know their is randomness and variation in spoteanity. It is these type of relationships that make the categorizations not be mutually exclusive. 

**Accuracy & Distortion**

Dondis compares accuracy with the realisticness of a piece: the work of a camera. This idea of accuracy and distortion relates to the conversations we’ve been having with our self-portraits. We distort its elements to create abstract meaning that represents us better than accuracy could, as it reaches beyond our physicality. 

**Singularity & Juxtaposition**

Dondis discusses the difference between works the focus on a solemn subject, versus those that focus on the relationship of multiple components. The name “juxtaposition” suggests the impact of the position of these multiple elements to achieve an effective and fruitful interaction in the work. This is a key components when it comes to the development of our self-portraits as well. As we implement multiple abstract elements, we want to ensure their relationships is legible and successful. 

**Neutrality & Accent**

The idea of neutrality and accent is similar to that of singularity and juxtaposition. Most notably, the accent refers to highlighting a particular element in the piece, which goes along the singularity idea of focusing on a particular element. Neutrality, on the other hand, is more about losing the boundaries for the elements within a piece, rather than establishing relationships between them, like is the case for juxtaposition. 

**Understatement & Exaggeration** 

I hadn’t really considered how understatement could be expressed within a design until Dondis provided the visual examples in this reading. The idea of creating simple, under defined elements that still carry across a message seems very challenging. It seems more effective, as Dondis states, to carry out exaggerated statements in these visual works. However, I believe this idea of minimalism has become more and more popular in the recent years. The simplification, which is another of the elements that Dondis discusses, of companies logos portrays how a designer seeks the “maximum response” from an audience, while showing “great restraint” in the design.
