**Metonymy**
I have this figure of speech specifically being used in the written context, such as in poetry, so it was interesting to learn more about it in the visual context. I think this tool is really effective when used in parallel with different contexts in the same set up, so I really liked the various examples for each section of the Chicago tribune, especially the one formed through backformation. 

**Metaphor**
Although I mainly think of metaphor in the literary context as well, this was one that I was more familiar with in the visual sense too. However, after having just read the metonymy section, I was left a little confused between the exact distinction between the two (I looked this up, and the distinction is that metaphor is more used for the substitution of two things whereas metonymy is used for the association of the two things). The example I thought of off the top of my head it the “Smoking Kills” one, where the shadow is a gun.

**Blending**
Conceptual blending was the most intriguing to me, as I have not previously encountered this concept before. It was interesting how the writer described blending as creating a new “mental space” in a way that allows for mapping that is not necessarily the sum of its parts.
