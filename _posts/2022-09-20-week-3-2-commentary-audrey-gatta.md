Dondis’s text explained and presented examples of techniques for visual communication that are ever-present in designs all around us, such as posters, UI, signs, book covers, and more. They are a toolkit that allows designers to employ the elements of design in meaningful ways. Although I always absorb their meaning and intentions, I rarely think about how these techniques work to make a design successful, so it was really helpful to read Dondis’s breakdown of these. I found it interesting how she highlighted the need for visual pre-planning in design, stating that “Sudden inspiration, mindlessness, is not an acceptable force in design.” To me, there can be a balance of both, because I feel like random strikes of inspirations can lead to great ideas that can later be thought through and refined visually. 

### Symmetry and Asymmetry
I was specifically draw to Dondis’s comparison of symmetry and asymmetry because I previously had a very traditional mindset when it came to this polarity: I associated symmetry with balance, and asymmetry with instability. However, here Dondis highlights how asymmetry is not necessarily ill-balanced: “balance can be achieved by variation in elements and placement, which is a counterpoise of weights.” I do think that the middle example that she presents for asymmetry exemplifies this quite well, because the design feels balanced without being symmetrical due to the distribution of weight, with the figure (which feels heavier) being toward the bottom of the page, while the text (which feels lighter) being at the top. 

### Understatement and Exaggeration 
I found “Understatement” and “Exaggeration” to be interesting polar techniques because even though they are opposite approaches, they are often used for the same goal. When used effectively, both of these can result in a bold and clear message. Understatement says more with less, while exaggeration really emphasizes a point, loud and clear. To me, the difference that marks when each one should be used is really dependent on the content itself. This goes back to the point that Dondis made earlier that “form follows content.”
