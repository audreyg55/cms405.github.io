Overall, I found these examples to be very interesting, even though the distinction between these three categories was not very distinctive to me personally and I would have difficulty categorizing them. 

**Metonymy**
I found the lipstick example the most compelling because of the extra complexity - because the person read the tribune's gift section, they bought a gift that their SO really enjoyed as signified by the abundant lipstick kisses. The other examples mostly only had one additional layer - read the tribune, bought a lamp and it became bright. However, some of these examples were also difficult to understand. For instance, the water cooler one, I originally interpreted it as before people weren't drinking water, then after reading about sports, they also decided to become more active and thus drank more water and became more healthy - rather than the water cooler being a stand-in for social interaction, in this case, I didn't understand the metonymy and thus misinterpreted the panel.

**Metaphor**
The metaphor panels were much more streamlined and easy to understand. I think it is because the metaphors they used are more accessible and more generally known, such as the weighted chain being an unpleasant burden on your life, moving up the escalator as a metaphor for advancing your career, etc. 

**Blending**
Conceptually, this category was the most interesting because as the reading mentioned, when we blend two concepts, the whole might be different from the meaning of the separate parts (the surgeon was a butcher). I would be interested in finding an example where the symptom of blending I mentioned above happens.

This advertisement and the spoof of it made by a coke fan are examples of metaphors because, in the original Pepsi advertisement, it is implied that Coca-Cola is scary (during Halloween, Pepsi is scary like Coca-Cola because of the cape), and in the spoof, it is implied that Pepsi wants to be heroic like CocaCola.
