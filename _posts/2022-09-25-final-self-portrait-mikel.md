Originally I think juxtaposition was a main part of how I tried to differentiate between the real clouds and the fake clouds. I also had the hands be photorealistic to match this, and form a strong contrast with the imaginary parts.

With the symmetry I wanted add some level of "fakeness" to the real parts that would then have this push pull affect with the question of which part feels more real.
