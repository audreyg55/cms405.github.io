In chapter 4, I find that through the process of anti aliasing, which is to make appearances more fuzzy, we as readers get the impression of clarity. It makes sense for larger font scales, since as the size increases, the jaggedness of the font becomes more obvious and less readable. To try and udnerstand what is happening, I think of it as scaling the slope of the diagonals into readable levels.

I went and found this image that demonstrated this idea since there were none in the chapter. The concept of anti aliasing was familiar because it often pops up in many video game settings! It is used in the same way, and has great impact on the graphics of the game.
