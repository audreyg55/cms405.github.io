Dondis' explanation of the different elements of visual communication was a really interesting read. It breaks down basic visual elements that I have never analyzed on a deeper level and explains why these commonplace elements are so powerful in communicating information. 

**Tone:** Dondis differentiated tonality in nature from tonaliy in graphics, which was particularly interesting. It allows graphics to convey information about perspective and dimension. The power of tone really can be shown through cross hatching. People are able to turn simple shapes into recognizable objects, by adding shading (i.e from a triangle into a more conical object). In a sense, the use of tone can be used to trick the eye into an optical illusion. Graphics that are only in grayscale are still able to convey a feeling of different colors through the varying tones of light and dark that are used. Designers can take advantage of tone by adding contrasting light or dark tones to a graphic, making it stand out more. 

**Color:** Color's ability to convey meaning through its different hues is extraordinarily powerful. Its core features are its three measurable dimensions: hue, saturation, and achromatic (relative brightness). Because color is so multi-dimensional (in contrast to tone which is a 1 dimension scale from light to dark), there are so many different ways to utilize color in a visual design. One of the striking examples to me, is that we are able to feel tactile sensations such as warmth or coldness through reds and blues respectively. When adding complementary colors together, you can draw attention to certain parts of the design. On an opposite front, using colors that are closer together on the color wheel can create a sense of harmony within a design.
