Dondis’s paper goes in depth on the different elements that create convincing visual depictions, and on the limitations of these elements, especially in two-dimensional pieces. 

### **LINE:**
One of the first elements that caught my eye was the line. Dondis's initial description of the line is very mathematical: a set of dots moving in the same direction. However, throughtout the reading its versatility is shown. It can be defintive, such as in writing or lithographs, and it can be unsure and wavering, such as in prevesualizations. When I first think of a drawing and/or sketch, I visualize a component of multiple lines interacting with each other. This aligns with Dondis's logic: that lines are crucial instruments of previsualization. Whenever I'm creating a 2D work, I always begin by thinking of my concepts in their most bare form: lines. However, as Dondi states, lines themselves rarely exist in nature, so these bare components are often the stepping stone to more complex works. An example of this is perspective. Although lines are crucial in creating dimension, they must be suplemented by other elements, such as tones, to convey a complete, convincing image. 


### **TONE:**
In connection to the line, a second element that interested me was the concept of tone. As Dondis states, the perspective and dimension of 2D works relies heavily on the use of different tones and shades. However, representing light in a work of visual design is hard, as we cannot represent true light, and are limited to the behaviors of paints, pencils, and other mediums. I suppose, subconsciously, I was aware of the cruciality of tone in 2D works. It is true that lines are not sufficient when it comes to creating perspective, a point that Dondis’s proves effectively with the example of a circle. A circle does not become three-dimensional, that is, a sphere, until we have added tones and shadings to supplement its shape. Often, as I’m mindlessly sketching, I’ll create a circle and shade it, but I had not realized the transformation it underwent. Moreover, an interesting point Dondis brings up is the limitation on the the human eye of how many different tones it can detect. In concept, there are infinite different tones between absolute white and black. However, as Dondis states, the human eye can only distinct around 30 of them. This means that when we observe the world around us, these tones with the slightest differences exist, but we cannot directly represent them on a 2D scale.
