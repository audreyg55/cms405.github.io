title: Experience Map First Idea - Mikel
author: Mikel
---
What kind of experience or imagination are you trying to map?
- Watching a tv show, specifically peopleâ€™s enjoyment or relationships to episodes/seasons/characters/elements

What are the dimensions of your experience/imagination that you are trying to visualize?
- Public reception, over time
- Maybe something to track how different parts of the show were seen at different times in its run? Overall perception of a show changes as more content comes out, like Game of Thrones being hated at the end while (older) shows like Buffy took a bit to get into their normal groove
- Critics vs ratings vs predominant online opinions

What is the data source for your mapping idea?
- Ranking articles (that rank seasons/characters/episodes from best to worst)
- Online discussion forums
- Rating data on how many people watch, and how that number changes over the course of the show (most shows decline in ratings over time but do they at all link up with critic or public opinion of those seasons?)

What are possible inspirations for your mapping idea? 
- Not sure
