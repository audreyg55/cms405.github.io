The concept of pictorialization reminds me of the points made in McCloud’s Chapter 6 reading: how writing started off as pictures depicting scenes in real-life. The McLean examples mentioned do seem to be calligraphy to me, especially the image of a words spelt out with a rope. It feels more adjacent to embellished fonts than it does to pictures. However, with the element of movement, I do see how this transforms into the kinetic typography described. However, is this movement restricted to the meaning of the word? Would a word that is animated in a way that’s irrelevant to its definition still fall underneath this umbrella?

The informalization is an interesting angle that I had not considered. Fonts, as discussed in previous readings, aid in conveying the emotions of some word, but it is true that movement better portrays the act of speaking. It is often the case, that we will be texting with someone, or writing something online, and some reader misinterprets our intention or tone, given the lack of voice variation. In a way, in formalization reminds me of the tone indicators that are often used to counter this problem. 

The emotivization seems very correlated to informalization. The idea of emotion behind font seems more applicable here, although I suppose it is separate from voice tempo and/or variation. However, I think informalization is caused by emotivization. The rhythm and tempo of one’s speech most often depends on their mood and/or emotions. Therefore, the line between these two characteristics seems a bit blurry. Nevertheless, it is true that the informalization is more direct. We often perceive a person’s tone before analyzing the emotions behind it. 

Once again, the idea of dynamicization correlates closely with that of pictorialization. Pictorialization is not only visual representations of words, but it includes movement. Dynamicization is the evolution from the static to the moving. Although I see the appeal in the advancement of staticness, I believe it is a bit drastic to state that “whatever is still static must become dynamic”. In a way, it rises this sense of urgency that, as the world moves, we move, and time moves, then everything else must also move. However, I think there is some appeal to the stillness of certain elements, even calligraphy at times. In a world where everything moves, we can find some peace in something sedimentary.
