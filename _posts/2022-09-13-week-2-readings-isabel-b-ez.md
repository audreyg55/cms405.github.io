In the second chapter of McCloud's "Understanding Comics", what most caught my attention was how McCloud expressed that our brains were programmed to see human faces in everything. He used the examples of doodles, cars, and electric plugs. I found it extremely interesting because it is true, I often think about how “mean” or “friendly” a car looks based on its headlights and bumper. I have sometimes even used this information to gauge the character of the person driving it, even if I can’t see them. It seems ridiculous, but it is a common occurrence amongst people. When McCloud expressed that we couldn’t convince our brains to not see a face when presented with a traditional smiley face, I tried to stare at it long enough to see if I could identify some other figure, to no avail. However, I do not necessarily agree that these attributes make us self-centered beings. Faces do not belong exclusively to humans. Most animals and insects also have faces consisting of two eyes and a mouth. When I look at these objects, such as the car, I do not necessarily see myself in them. In fact, I think I relate them more closely to other creatures than I do to humans. I do, however, understand the concept of having some objects as an extension to our bodies, as the car example. However, I think this is more directly connected to the fact that, in our subconscious, we are aware that if something touches/hits the object we are on or holding, we will feel it. If someone hits our car, we feel the impact. If someone knocks down a cup that we’re holding, we feel its absence. This awareness is what I think causes that mental extension of our bodies.
