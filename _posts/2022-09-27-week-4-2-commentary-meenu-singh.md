In this paper, Ramachandran and Hirstein outline an approach for understanding the laws of artistic experience. They describe eight such laws and analyze them in three components: the logic of art (the laws themselves), its evolutionary rationale (why and how the laws developed), and the neurophysiology (what happens in our brain from a scientific perspective). I thought the structure of the paper was very easy to follow and I really appreciated their attempt to understand the scientific reason why we view art in certain ways.

**Peak Shift Principle** : I really liked the explanation of the peak shift principle being applied in different dimensions. The concept that there are different "spaces" other than form space such as color space or even "beak space" that can be exaggerated or caricaturized was fascinating. They were able to compare this to how rats are more stimulated when recognizing longer/more exaggerated rectangles as opposed to the original rectangle presented to them showed that this response is measurable. 

**Generic Viewpoint**: This concept reminded me of a previous topic we covered in class, the Gestalt Psychology's Law of Pr√§gnanz (Good Form). The Gestalt Law suggests that we tend to organize what we're looking at into the simplest forms possible. However, I feel like the concept of Generic Viewpoint took the Law of Pragnanz and devloped it further in a manner which explains more clearly why we tend to do this through Bayesian Logic. The authors suggest that our visual system dislikes interpretations of art which rely on "strange coincidences" that are deemed improale.  

**Contrast Extraction**:
