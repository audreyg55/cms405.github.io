In this paper, Ramachandran and Hirstein outline an approach for understanding the laws of artistic experience. They describe eight such laws and analyze them in three components: the logic of art (the laws themselves), its evolutionary rationale (why and how the laws developed), and the neurophysiology (what happens in our brain from a scientific perspective). I thought the structure of the paper was very easy to follow and I really appreciated their attempt to understand the scientific reason why we view art in certain ways.
