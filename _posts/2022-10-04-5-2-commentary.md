While I thought this reading was a great way to tie in earlier concepts from the Dondis reading (regularity, balance, etc), I thought this chapter was wildly outdated. I struggled to agree with the author's claims that certain fonts looked better paired with the emotional photos because honestly I didn't think any of them paired well. The fonts felt stale to me. They looked like the default fonts from 2004 Microsoft Word. But, maybe I'm too jaded by the Gen Z clean Sans Serif and isometric angle photograph of modern product marketing to have an open mind.

But the icing on the cake was the final page talking about designing for screens and bitmap fonts. I couldn't take that seriously. Very few modern type designers dream of designing an 8-bit font. I understand the point about designing within constraints. However, when I consider modern font design, I think about [open source](https://www.velvetyne.fr/), or [variable fonts](https://v-fonts.com/), or [responsive fonts](http://btriz.pt/adaptype/). All of these font design domains have to do with the exploring the untapped potential of fonts on screens, not how screens limit fonts.

This reading left me yearning for more.
