While I thought this reading was a great way to tie in earlier concepts from the Dondis reading (regularity, balance, etc), I thought this chapter was wildly outdated. I struggled to agree with the author's claims that certain fonts looked better paired with the emotional photos because honestly I didn't think any of them paired well. The fonts felt stale to me. They looked like the default fonts from 2004 Microsoft Word. But, maybe I'm too jaded by the Gen Z clean Sans Serif and isometric angle photograph of modern product marketing to have an open mind.

But the icing on the cake was the final page talking about bitmap fonts. I couldn't take that seriously. Never in my life will I design an 8-bit font. When I think of modern font design (which I know *minimal* about), I think about [open source](https://www.velvetyne.fr/), or [variable fonts](https://v-fonts.com/), or [responsive fonts](http://btriz.pt/adaptype/) all designed for the web. 

This reading left me yearning for more.
