**Harrell Response**

The Harrell reading was fairly confusing to me, and I got bogged down in the use of the different terms that were similar enough that they often got mixed up in my head. I think the Brawn example was useful in understanding how we code our own biases into a computing system, especially when it comes to individual “epistemic domains.” I look at the eBay representation and instinctively see it as containing a useful set of information, but I realize how this might just be because it was what was offered to me.
I think the section on basic semiotics was interesting and provided many ideas that were easy to follow, but I got confused at the difference between icons and indexes. I think more examples of indexes would let me understand what makes them different from icons, because right now they seem too similar to me to have unique terms.

**Gestalt Theory Response**

I think the examples given for the Gestalt Theory laws were fun, especially because some of them took some understanding but mostly made complete sense. The law of figure/ground confused me since I wasn’t sure how the definition linked to the images? I saw many of the images to contain at least two different common ways of viewing them, and seeing a different image, but I wasn’t sure if that was what I was supposed to understand.
