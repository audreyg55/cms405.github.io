Californian: I chose this font purely based on its name. I went to middle and high school in Southern California and it is a big part of my identity.
Courier: I'm a 6-2 major so I code very frequently, so Courier is the font I see most often in my day-to-day life. I colored it green because that's how my name would appear on python as a string.
Kiran Haerang: This is a font I used to love back in elementary school in Korea. I like how irregular and spontaneous the font is. Since the font was designed for use in Korean script, I wrote my Korean name on the side as well.
