**Alconica:** I picked this font because I was drawn to the curves in the 'n' and 'h'. They both appear very similar to the way some letters look in hindi and so I thought this was a very cool representation of my background identity.

**Calibri Light:** My full name is fairly long in terms of the number of characters. Because of this, I am often drawn to fonts that have lighter + thinner strokes, because it feels like it makes the length of my name look more balanced.

**Freestyle Script:** This font is an ode to my personality. I think I am very chaotic and I felt that a script that has a more handwriting, scrawl look to it would represent that aspect of my life.
