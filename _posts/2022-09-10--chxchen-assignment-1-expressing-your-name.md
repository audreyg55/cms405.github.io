**1. Helvetica**: The first font I chose was Helvetica -- when I first started gaining interest in visual design, I religiously used Helvetica (specifically with low font spacing). It's a very simple font, but I think when used well it's very clean and serves its function well, which I hope reflects myself.

**2. Squarely**: My second font is called Squarely and it's a font I downloaded for a video game creating class last year. I love how the vibes of this font reflect a sort of indie/creative game, which I really enjoy.

**3. Moonrise**: My third font is called Moonrise and it's the last font I downloaded to use in a thumbnail. I like this font because it looks pretty simple at first, but there's slight variations in the height that make it interesting.
