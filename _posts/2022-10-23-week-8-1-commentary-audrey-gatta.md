I found this reading to be a bit dense, and I wish it had included more visual examples, but it did touch on many interesting points of the history of kinetic typography, its grammar, and its current use. The writers describe how kinetic typography was developed in the context of film titles and animated electric screen. With kinetic typography being everywhere nowadays, I didn’t really realize its origins. Also, the text went into the early examples of kinetic design: “Serifs could suggest shoes, as in Warde’s example, because, in common with shoes, they are elongated horizontals on which something stands. Vibration could suggest fear because when we Social Semiotics 247 are afraid we tremble. The splitting of words could suggest the splitting of the mind in schizophrenia.” It is interesting to think about how kinetic text has evolved from these more simple meanings to complex and multidimensional pieces. Now, kinetic text is everywhere: the authors dived into this by describing their use in contemporary software, like PowerPoint. When I think of an example of kinetic text, I usually think of moving news headlines that portray a sense of urgency.
