I really like the Loki opening sequence, because the sequence itself gives context to how Loki is viewed by the Time Variance Agency once they captured him, and all of the work that went into that. However, the actual text of "Loki" at the end of the film is particularly nice, because one, it changes in time to the score, but also the changing fonts refer to the "tricky" nature of Loki and his changing faces.
