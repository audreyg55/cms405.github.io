This reading gave great insight into typefaces, and it was much more intuitive than some of the previous readings. I found the shoe and font especially intersting because I could properly map the fonts to the pictures. I also asked a friend to try it, and she matched them correctly as well. I found his point about learning all of the graphic expectations before trying to break them logical. This makes sense because if someone who isn't experienced tries to break an expectation, they may accidentally make it seem like a less experienced graphic designer made a mistake.

Tying back to Dondis' ideas, typeface rely strongly on shape and form, as well as dynamics for movement. These ideas can be cross referenced and make sense relatively to each other.

Fonts that I enjoy looking at are often from video games because they have unique and recognizable designs similar to logos.

Examples include Stray, Risk of Rain, and Stardew Valley.
