### Chapter 2

Once as an icebreaker I was asked, “What would you wear as the cartoon character version of yourself?” It made me question what clothes I would choose to extend my identity. My fixed expression of self. McCloud’s discussion of our investment in inanimate objects resonated with me. He talked about how inanimate objects (clothes for example) can trigger transformations of ourselves. I’m sure many of us would feel different in pajamas vs an evening ball gown. And, in the same vein, there are times I wouldn’t feel myself if I didnt have some of my staple objects. Call me materialistic - but I identify with the objects that have essence and communicate my values.

### Chapter 5

I liked McCloud’s point that while there are lots of symbols + icons that garner universal linguistic understanding. For example, a fly symbolizes a nasty smell. However, I found it even more interesting that certain cultures develop separate idiosyncratic meanings for their symbols - example Japanese facial expressions. I’d never seen the Japanese facial expressions before. And it made me wonder - are there American symbols that are intensely American that I don’t realize are?
