One of the first examples of effective use of dots + lines is the mobile game Two Dots. The entire premise of the game is to connect dots of the same color using lines. Many of the levels reflect and emphasize this premise through their design. There are no other obvious design features within each of the levels and so all of the user's attention is drawn to the dots on their screen which are evenly spaced in a grid like pattern. When the user begins to make connections between the two dots, the other primary visual feature is revealed, lines of the same color as the dots you are connecting.
