I found the stereo illustrations to be very interesting. At first, I wasn’t seeing the 3D scene, but then I went cross-eyed and eventually say it. However, I’m unconvinced that that image gave me any more information about the depth of the scene than each image viewed separately. It honestly felt more like I was looking through a magnifying glass or lenticular printing.

I found the sunspot and Java railroad line examples to be impossible to follow because they were too complex. The Japanese weather diagram was easy to follow because the symbols are pretty much stand-ins for their meanings (a sun means sunny, etc). Even though I am not familiar with the topography of Japan, I could still make out where the weather corresponded to what location just based on geography and relativity to the north and south ends of the islands (and of course aided by the text, too).

However, it is not just sheer amounts of data/the presence of numbers that led me to draw that conclusion, because I really liked the stem and leaf plot that depicted the heights of 218 volcanoes. Objectively, 218 data points is on the same magnitude as the data portrayed in the sunspot and railroad line example (albeit the data is more one-dimensional), but I found the stem and leaf plot to be easy to navigate, and it also gave me a good sense of the height distribution. 

I thought the chart from United States v. Gotti to be very interesting, because as Tufte wrote, in terms of space, only 37% of the boxes are marked, and yet because of the long steaks (such as under Polisi) and because of the accumulation of marks under more severe crimes which are listed at the top, the mind draws the conclusion that there is a lot of criminal activity going on.
