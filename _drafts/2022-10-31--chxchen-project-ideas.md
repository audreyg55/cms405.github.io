Some concepts I would be interested in exploring are fantasy maps and maps with ties to my heritage or upbringing. I really like studying how fantasy maps are constructed and particularly their ties and inspiration from real geographic locations, so it might be cool to take a map from either a game or novel I like and interactively explore where the inspiration for these fantasy locations comes from. The data would be sourced from whatever information the publishers have made readily available and maybe also fan theories.

I would also be open to exploring maps with ties to my own heritage or upbringing, either related to my upbringing as a Chinese-American or the places I’ve grown up with. I think another interesting idea I’ve thought about is the growth of cities, particularly ones that have experienced recent bursts of growth (i.e. Atlanta, Toronto, Seattle, etc.), and seeing what new developments have arrived at these cities to help them grow recently.
